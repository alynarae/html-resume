<h1>A little more about me...</h1>

<p>My childhood dream was to be a teacher.</p>
<p>There were obvious things that drew me to the profession; leadership positions, influencing the trajectory of people's lives, the fun nature of the youth, and the smell of coffee from the teacher's break room. ‚òï</p>
<p>Although I may not want to be a teacher anymore, I find myself gravitating towards roles that still have all those things (especially the coffee) and as I dive deeper into the world of UX, I'm starting to see the parallels.</p>
<p>In UX, I bring my love for understanding people, advocating and contributing within team projects, and agile thinking to my work. I always make sure that I connect closely with my clients too, to make sure I accurately present their brand voice in their products.üìî</p>

<h2>Additionally, I live a double life...</h2>
<p>‚ù§ UX aside, I am also an aerial instructor and performer. In an odd sense, I am the most grounded when my feet are off the floor. Up in the air, I am tenacious, ambitious, expressive and most importantly, vibrant; the energy I aim to bring to all the work I do.</p>
